<h3><i>About<i></h3>
<p style="color:white;">Jeon Jung-kook (Korean: 전정국; born September 1, 1997), known mononymously as Jungkook (stylized as Jung Kook), is a South Korean singer. He is a member and vocalist of the South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
<p style="color:white;">Jungkook has released three solo tracks as part of BTS' discography—"Begin" in 2016, "Euphoria" in 2018, and "My Time" in 2020—all of which charted on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart. He also recorded the soundtrack song "Stay Alive" for the BTS-based webtoon 7Fates: Chakho. In 2022, he featured on American singer-songwriter Charlie Puth's single "Left and Right", which peaked at number 22 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Later that year, he became the first South Korean artist to release an official song for the FIFA World Cup soundtrack with "Dreamers", which he subsequently performed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup Opening Ceremony. Jungkook's solo tracks have also seen success on streaming platforms, with "Dreamers", "Stay Alive", and "Left and Right" each breaking the record for the highest-debuting song by a Korean soloist on the Spotify Global chart</p>
